## Partially Working
- **JavaScript**: ⚠️ Parser fixed, but validation fails
- **Go**: ⚠️ Parser fixed, but validation fails

## Not Working
- **Rust, Java, C++, Ruby**: ❌ Not tested or not extracting

## Recommendations
1. Deploy Python extraction immediately
2. Investigate JS/Go quality filter issues
3. Test remaining languages with simple code first
4. Consider language-specific validation rules
